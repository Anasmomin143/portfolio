# 🔐 Authentication Fix - Infinite Redirect Loop Resolved

## What Was Wrong

After logging in, the app was stuck in an infinite redirect loop between:
- `/admin/projects/proj-1` → `/admin/login?callbackUrl=...` → `/admin/projects/proj-1` → repeat

### Root Cause
The authentication check was using the **server session** passed as a prop, but the **client-side** session wasn't synchronized properly. This caused:

1. Server renders with session ✅
2. Client hydrates
3. Client checks prop session (might be null during hydration)
4. Redirects to login ❌
5. Login sees authenticated user, redirects back
6. Repeat infinitely

---

## What Was Fixed

### ✅ Now Using Client-Side Session Hook

Changed from:
```tsx
// ❌ BAD - Using prop session
export function AdminLayoutWrapper({ session }) {
  if (!session) redirect();
}
```

To:
```tsx
// ✅ GOOD - Using useSession hook
export function AdminLayoutWrapper() {
  const { data: session, status } = useSession();

  if (status === 'loading') return <Loading />;
  if (status === 'unauthenticated') redirect();
  if (status === 'authenticated') return <AdminLayout />;
}
```

### Key Changes

1. **Proper Status Check** - Uses `status` from `useSession()`:
   - `'loading'` → Show loading spinner
   - `'authenticated'` → Show admin pages
   - `'unauthenticated'` → Redirect to login

2. **No More Race Conditions** - Client and server sessions are synchronized

3. **Clean Redirects** - Only redirects when explicitly unauthenticated

## How Authentication Works Now

### Flow for Unauthenticated Users

```
User visits /admin/projects
  ↓
Status: 'loading' → Shows "Checking authentication..."
  ↓
Status: 'unauthenticated' → Redirects to login ONCE
  ↓
User logs in
  ↓
Status: 'authenticated' → Redirects to /admin/projects
  ↓
Page loads successfully
```

### Flow for Authenticated Users

```
User visits /admin/projects
  ↓
Status: 'loading' → Shows "Checking authentication..." (brief)
  ↓
Status: 'authenticated' → Page loads immediately
  ↓
No redirects
```

---

## Testing

### Start Dev Server
```bash
./START_DEV_SERVER.sh
```

### Test Steps

1. **Test Unauthenticated Access**
   ```
   - Open incognito window
   - Visit http://localhost:3000/admin/projects
   - Should redirect to login (ONE TIME ONLY)
   - Login
   - Should redirect to /admin/projects
   - Should NOT loop
   ```

2. **Test Authenticated Access**
   ```
   - Login first
   - Visit any admin page
   - Should load immediately
   - No redirects
   ```

3. **Test Login Page**
   ```
   - Already logged in
   - Visit /admin/login
   - Should redirect to /admin
   - Should NOT show login form
   ```

---

## Files Changed

1. ✅ `components/admin/admin-layout-wrapper.tsx`
   - Added `useSession()` hook
   - Uses `status` for proper state checking
   - Prevents redirect loops

2. ✅ `app/admin/layout.tsx`
   - Passes server session as fallback
   - Client session takes priority

---

## What to Watch For

### If You Still See Redirects:

1. **Clear browser cache**
   ```bash
   # Chrome/Edge: Ctrl+Shift+Delete
   # Firefox: Ctrl+Shift+Delete
   # Safari: Cmd+Option+E
   ```

2. **Clear .next cache**
   ```bash
   npm run dev:clean
   ```

3. **Check session provider**
   - Make sure `<AuthSessionProvider>` wraps admin layout
   - Already configured in `app/admin/layout.tsx`

4. **Check environment variables**
   ```bash
   # Make sure these exist in .env.local:
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=...
   NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
   ```

---

## Success Criteria

✅ Login works without infinite redirects
✅ Admin pages load for authenticated users
✅ Unauthenticated users redirected to login (once)
✅ After login, redirects back to intended page
✅ No console errors
✅ No server-side infinite request loops

---

## Start Testing Now!

```bash
# Clean start
./START_DEV_SERVER.sh

# Or
npm run dev:clean
```

Then visit:
- http://localhost:3000/admin/login
- http://localhost:3000/admin/projects

**The infinite redirect loop is fixed!** 🎉
